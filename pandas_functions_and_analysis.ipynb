I think the main selling point of `ruff` here is just the ease of implementing new rules, like the currently unenabled `pytest.warns` one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major difference is that `unwanted-patterns-in-tests` is currently only enabled in `pandas/tests` while with this implementation, `TID251` will be enabled globally. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several approaches we can explore to reconcile the 2 behaviors. \\r\\n- Keep it globally enabled for rule where the number of errors is low (and keep using `pygrep`) for the rest\\r\\n- Use [hierarchical configuration](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#pyprojecttoml-discovery) (I think `pandas` doesn't use it at the moment, so this will be a fairly big change)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere's an open issue to track the progress of [flat configuration](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/7696), which allows us to keep all rules within 1 config file, but there's not much progress lately.\",\n",

Please document this exception in a callout because it\\'s dangerous to assume that the iloc-like behavior is general.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW, could someone give a rationale for this behavior? Is there a general rule that ends up in this weird situation, like \"if index and slice are int -> iloc, if not then if slice is of the type of the index -> loc else if slice is int -> iloc else fail\", and then an int slice is taken to be of the type of a float index?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Suggested fix for documentation\\n\\nDocument this exception in a callout because it\\'s dangerous to assume that the iloc-like behavior is general.',\n",

In previous pandas versions this did not happen. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\ntso.Second()/10 should return tso.Milli(100) and not tso.Day(0). \\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : f538741432edf55c6b9fb5d0d496d2dd1d7c2457\\r\\npython                : 3.10.11.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Windows\\r\\nOS-release            : 10\\r\\nVersion               : 10.0.22621\\r\\nmachine               : AMD64\\r\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 154 Stepping 4, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : de_DE.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : de_DE.cp1252\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.25.2\\r\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 65.5.0\\r\\npip                   : 23.0.1\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : 7.4.0\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.14.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.3\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.58.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.11.3\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.19\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
